#smart street lights 

This project is made by using 2 ultrasonic sensor and a single arduino board..
The main purpose behind the project was to lit up the LEDS(street lights) only when the sensor gets them in the specifed range..
i.e only turning on the lights when the car is near that light pole , so as to save the electricity being used in the street lights.

The pin nos and the pins to which the leds are being connected is also specified in the code so as to make the work easier to people who read this code...
each block contains 4 LEDS and all are connected to one single arduino pin, so that the entire block lits up in the single output.
